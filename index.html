        <h2>Health Benefits of Fermented Foods</h2>
        <p>Fermented foods support gut health by balancing bacteria, aiding digestion, and reducing bloating. They enhance nutrient absorption, making vitamins more bioavailable, and boost immunity by stimulating antibody production. Fermentation also reduces lactose content, making dairy easier to digest, while probiotics help break down complex foods. Additionally, a healthy gut improves brain function, potentially reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.</p>
